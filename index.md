## **About Me**
I am an associate lecturer in Finance and Technology of Institute(IFT),  University College London. Prior to  joining IFT, I was a postdoc in the Machine Learning group at University of Oxford and worked with Prof. Xiaowen Dong, Prof. Janet Pierrehumbert and Dr. Isabelle Lorge. I obtained my PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science, Machine Learning Group, University of Sheffield and my supervisors are Prof. Haiping Lu and Prof. Nikos Aletras. 
<br/>
My rsearch research focuses on machine learning, graph representation learning (GRL), and graph neural networks (GNNs) and related application on social network, financial network analysis.
