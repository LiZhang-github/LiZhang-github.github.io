## **About Me**
I am an associate lecturer in Finance and Technology of Institute(IFT),  University College London. Prior to  joining IFT, I was a postdoc in the Machine Learning group at University of Oxford and worked with Prof. Xiaowen Dong, Prof. Janet Pierrehumbert and Dr. Isabelle Lorge. I obtained my PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science, Machine Learning Group, University of Sheffield and my supervisors are Prof. Haiping Lu and Prof. Nikos Aletras.

## **Research**
My research interest lies in the intersection of statistics and computation. Currently, I am focusing on better understanding computational tasks on graphs using tools such as probability theory, statistics, spectral methods, optimization, etc. My research involves proposing data-driven algorithms together with mathematical proofs, and at the same time, I seek to understand the nature of the problems and algorithms through the lens of those proofs. I am excited to see the transformation of ideas across different research fields.
